## ðŸ§­ Explanation

- **`public/`** â€“ Static assets like images, icons, or `robots.txt`.
- **`src/app/`** â€“ Root for routing and layouts in App Router-based structure.
- **`components/`** â€“ Shared UI building blocks, split for clarity (`ui/`, `form/`, `layout/`).
- **`features/`** â€“ Encapsulated features like authentication, dashboard logic, etc.
- **`styles/`** â€“ Tailwind base config or global styles.
- **`lib/`** â€“ Helper functions, formatters, etc.
- **`hooks/`** â€“ Reusable custom React hooks.
- **`types/`** â€“ TypeScript types and interfaces.
- **`constants/`** â€“ Static values, enums, app-level labels.
- **`services/`** â€“ API calls and services using Axios, fetch, etc.
- **`store/`** â€“ Global state management (Zustand, Redux).
- **`config/`** â€“ App-wide configuration like SEO, routes, metadata.
- **`middleware.ts`** â€“ Middleware logic (auth, redirects).
- **`app.tsx`** â€“ Entry point for the app.

## React/Next.js Project Standards

- Make a proper flow and then execute.
  - Never work without a flow because when the project scales, new changes can break your improper flow, which creates functional bugs.
- Proper project structure.
- Proper code splitting â€” max lines 450â€“500.
- Must have absolute paths.
- Must have ESLint & Husky.
- Use less local state.
- Use Context or Redux state for universal state.
- Less prop drilling.
- Less npm usage.
- No conditioning in common components.
  - If it's any field component, then make sure its change is handled by the parent component.
  - This makes the component more dynamic â€” we can control it with state or Formik.
- Less npm usage.
  - If it can be done with simple code, never use npm for that â€” unnecessary npm will drop performance of CI/CD pipeline and the project itself.
- Make sure to write proper comments.
- Use `useCallback` & `memo` to memoize components and heavy functions.
  - Make sure if your component is memoized, it only renders if props change.
  - If you're passing state functions or any other setter functions, which create a new reference every time, it leads to re-renders. Make sure to use `useCallback` on those functions.
- Use common classes for Tailwind/CSS.
